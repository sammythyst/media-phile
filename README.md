# Media Phile microblog

## Description

We chose to make this microblog because we love art and want to create a new forum for artists to share their work. 

Our microblog allows users to share their art through online posts containing a title, description, and a media file. 

This app allows the public to be able to share their creativity on a public forum.

Some of the things we learned during our project were how to work with handlebars, Huroku, models, databases, seeds, routes.
